Project 2

Choosen MongoDB NoSQL as a data storage to retrieve the data from.
  - MongoDB is a document storage which is easy to web data and highly scalable.
  - Easy to understand and huge community which an help to resolve any issue.
  - Very much comfortabe for me as compared other free databases such as postgres and redis.
  - is good to store the non structured data.

Difficult:
  - Assynchronous handling of the result of the ajax request.
  - Keeping track of global variables in the asynchronous functions of ajax.
  - Making only 100 requests when more than 100 records in the DB.
  - Storing only 20 records at any time.

Easy:
  - Setting up of the MongoDB.
  - Animating the response and displaying.
  - I have used same technologies as earlier so it was very easy for me to implement new client changes.

My biggest concern 
  - Is choosing the backend db and front end technologies.
  - Handling Multiple response from different requests.
  - following the procedures. nd creating the process of development using these technologies.



project 1


Client using NodeJS and ReactJS:
  - ReactJs is a client side framework which works on module development
  - This is very helpful to test each and every component in the realtime environment
  - Development and integration is easy
  - Rendering the reactJs on the server is easy
  - Readability and ease of learning
  - We can integrate it with framweorks such as jQuery,Angular and backbone.js
  - Maintanence is also easy because component maintanence
  
Server Using NodeJS and ExpressJs:
Node:
  - NodeJs works basically on the logic of Asynchronous event handling
  - High performance: Because of its asynchronous handling, It does not wait on any events hence it can serve more requests
  - Scalability, Addition of new nodes on nodeJs is easy
Express:  
  - ExpressJs handles all the book keeping asks of http requests and responses
  - Integrates view engines such as jade
  - Express is very easy to understand

Additional Libraries:

  - highcharts for graph development 
  - googl map apis to include map
  - jQuery for Ajax reuests,
  - Gulp for the ease of development

Commands to install and deploy:
  - npm install
  to install required packages from npm
  - npm run serve
  to  build all the client side code
  - npm start
  to start the server
